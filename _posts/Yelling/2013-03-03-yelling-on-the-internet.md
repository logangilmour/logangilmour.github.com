I've decided to start blogging. Even typing the word “blogging” makes me feel somewhat dirty, but I'm getting over it. 

Lately, I’ve been thinking about what I want to do with my life. It’s become clear that in order to accomplish my goals I'm going to need to be able to get my ideas out of my brain and into the brains of other people. I’m thinking it will be good practice to occasionally translate my thoughts into a bloggish form that people can understand.

I’ve also realized that people might actually want to read about some of the things I do. I spend an inordinate amount of time trying out controversial life-hacks, designing convoluted new ways to program computers, and inventing pseudoscientific philosophies. Right now, for instance, I’m lifting bags of rocks and fasting 16 hours per day in an attempt to lose the weight I put on over the holidays. This has piqued the curiosity of pretty much every person I’ve mentioned it to. It’s wacky and effective - I guess people like that.

I’m hoping that writing down my current ideas and dreams will help to crystallize them into well-defined projects that I can actually complete. I’m also hoping that the stuff I holler into the void will be useful (or at least entertaining) to the people who read it. We live in the future, and the future is a complicated place. I’m pretty sure we all need to work together to figure out how to be good humans in this modern world.
