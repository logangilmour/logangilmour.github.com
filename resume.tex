\emph{ThirtyThree}
\vspace{\baselineskip}

Built the game RunGunJumpGun for PC/Mac/iOS/Android using Unity3D. Designed a cellular automata system for procedurally aided level design. Developed a palette-based sprite rendering system. Built a custom collision detection system. Designed many of the game's levels. Wrote code to procedurally generate some art assets. Implemented a promotional website. Integrated with Steam, iOS, Android, and Mac App store for achievements and leaderboards. Added analytics and wrote R scripts for statistical analysis of user playthroughs to improve difficulty progression.


\subsection*{Graphics Programmer}

\emph{ScopeAR}
\vspace{\baselineskip}

Built several Augmented Reality step-by-step instructional applications using an in-house tool built on top of Unity3D. Rebuilt the animation system at the core of that tool to create a robust and intuitive authoring tool for step-by-step instructional content that is target toward for users of limited technical ability. Designed a variety of shaders and rendering techniques that can highlight or deemphasize content, and a system for applying these visibility modifiers in a heirarchical way. Developed a content management system that accesses and downloads that content via the internet.
