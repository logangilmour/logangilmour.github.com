{% include JB/setup %}

I want to help grow new ways for information to flow.

This place is for broadcasting my misguided ideas about beauty, communication, and life out into the universe.

### Some of my stuff:

I write things down sometimes - that's here.

I'm a programmer - check out my [github](http://github.com/logangilmour) to see some frighteningly undocumented code.

You can have a look at my [resume](resume.pdf) if you are interested in hiring me.

I also like to compose and play music - check out my [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/logangilmour) and [myspace](http://www.myspace.com/unicornmachine) profiles for some sketchy basement recordings.
