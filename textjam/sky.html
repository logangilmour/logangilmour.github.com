<p>I shot straight up - to find the grot!</p>
  <p>Expecting doom, I pushed my thought</p>
  <p>out into the infospace</p>
  <p>grown up in this desert place</p>

  <p class="new">To live on as a wandering mind</p>
  <p>In wild machines that slowly grind</p>
  <p>all structured order into noise.</p>
  <p>I'd claim from life a last few joys.</p>

  <p class="new">But looking up, the grot stood stilled.</p>
  <p>Then folded inward, crushed and killed</p>
  <p>by what? It seemed the very air</p>
  <p>The little bird remarked: "And... there."</p>

    <p class="new">"You're hybrid, but coherent too!"</p>
<p>"Ha! I'm crazy through and through."</p>
  <p>He laughed and spun a circle 'round</p>
  <p>my moonlit hull, then hovered, frowned.</p>

  <p class="new">"I guess it's just by force of will.</p>
  <p>The purist world's begun to still - </p>
  <p>I had no choice. I had to try.</p>
  <p>My last form - much like yours - had died.</p>

  <p class="new">That grot's pure nano - dying breed.</p>
  <p>The hybrid cell's a vicous seed,</p>
  <p>Infecting, spreading co-evolved</p>
  <p>It's all that's left. So I've resolved</p>
  
  <p class="new">to keep the entropy at bay,</p>
  <p>both here and in the infospace.</p>
  <p>My hybrid cells expose me to</p>
  <p>a host of viral softies - true.</p>

  <p class="new">It's better than our kin who drift,</p>
  <p>and through this infrastucture sift</p>
  <p>decaying disembodied minds</p>
  <p>uploaded to organic lines.</p>

  <p class="new">My name's Felix, by the way.</p>
  <p>Let's stick together for a day</p>
  <p>or a million. What's it been?</p>
  <p>A thousand years? A single scene?"</p>

  <a class="new" href="stick-around.html">Should I say I'll stick
  around,</a>
  <a href="fly-away.html">or fly away without a sound?</a>
