<div id="holder">
<p>I followed close, though he was small.</p>
<p>I scraped a wing against a wall</p>
<p>of living stone filled through with light</p>
<p>that glowed against the coming night.</p>

  <p class="new">Above, behind, the grot screamed rage</p>
  <p>but fainter, fainter, as the cage</p>
  <p>of ancient radio towers loomed</p>
  <p>where rusty little flowers bloomed.</p>

<p class="new">Our pace diminished as the air</p>
<p>grew dimmer and I turned to stare</p>
<p>and wonder if my judgement failed</p>
<p>in following this bird I trailed.</p>

<p class="new">"All this life - it's hybrid, right?"</p>
<p>"Yep! Like me. Well... not quite"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" I asked him then.</p>
<p>"I was a man - like you, my friend."</p>

  <p class="new">"You're hybrid, but coherent too!"</p>
<p>"Ha! I'm crazy through and through."</p>
  <p>He laughed and spun a circle 'round</p>
  <p>my moonlit hull, then hovered, frowned.</p>

  <p class="new">"I guess it's just by force of will.</p>
  <p>The purist world's begun to still - </p>
  <p>I had no choice. I had to try.</p>
  <p>My last form - much like yours - had died.</p>

  <p class="new">That grot's pure nano - dying breed.</p>
  <p>The hybrid cell's a vicous seed,</p>
  <p>Infecting, spreading co-evolved</p>
  <p>It's all that's left. So I've resolved</p>
  
  <p class="new">to keep the entropy at bay,</p>
  <p>both here and in the infospace.</p>
  <p>My hybrid cells expose me to</p>
  <p>a host of viral softies - true.</p>

  <p class="new">It's better than our kin who drift,</p>
  <p>through wildish infrastucture sift</p>
  <p>decaying disembodied minds</p>
  <p>uploaded to organic lines.</p>

  <p class="new">My name's Felix, by the way.</p>
  <p>Let's stick together for a day</p>
  <p>or a million. What's it been?</p>
  <p>A thousand years? A single scene?"</p>

  <a class="new" href="stick-around.html">Should I say I'll stick
  around,</a>
  <a href="fly-away.html">or fly away without a sound?</a>
