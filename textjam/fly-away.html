<p>I tried to fly away but found</p>
  <p>myself remaining near the ground.</p>
  <p>Felix sighed. "I'd hoped you'd stay.</p>
  <p>Of your own will. But anyway.</p>

<p class="new">I watch as felix stiffened, fell.</p>
<p>"You see, although it's hard to tell</p>
  <p>I'm already inside your ship!</p>
  <p>I found a way through which to slip.</p>

<p class="new">First things first, your weapons suck.</p>
  <p>You must be blessed with ample luck.</p>
  <p>Your flash is dim, your din is dumb</p>
  <p>I'll fix you up with hybrid scum</p>
  
  <p class="new">that settled in your steel pores</p>
  <p>will form a strata for new spores</p>
  <p>to root into your neural net.</p>
  <p>We'll be the fiercest fighter yet!"</p>
