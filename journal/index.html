Been working a lot lately. Seems like deadlines at work and on the game are synced up. A bit tired, but not too stressed. Excited to submit rungun to IndieCade on Sunday.
</p><p> Fed up with my weight problems. Going to lean hard into behaviour modifications to try to solve this forever. I've got to get exercise going regularly again. I'm also getting really in to frozen food, which is apparently more nutritious because they harvest it more optimally and it's exposed to less air and light. Conveniently, it's also easier to keep on hand than fresh, so hopefully the barrier to me eating well will be lower. I'm finding stir-frying brocolli, cauliflower, green beans, and carrots from frozen to be quite delicious. From looking at a study, I should be buying my carrots fresh though. They keep forever, and they're cheaper fresh.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of fresh vegetables, our garden is sprouting! A weird little after-thought row of brocolli I put in a shady spot behind a tree was one of the first things to sprout. Very exciting. I think gardening might become one of the things I 'do'. It seems so unlikely to work when you're just tossing seeds in the dry ground and shuffling some dirt over them, but then they grow!
</p>
<p>Watched the first episode of Mr. Robot. Liked it.</p>
<p>A I writing this for an audience? I don't know. It's cool, however, that all of the entries here so far only add up to 96kb. Plain, minimal html is pretty light! I can keep just appending to this one file for ages. Probably, connection speeds will increase quickly enough that even when this is several megs it'll still load in like a quarter of a second. Heck, for lots of people, we're already there.</p>
<p> I've been feeling hazy the last few months. Good, and very productive, but hazy. It's been hard to keep track of the days and what I've been doing. I think I'm feeling a little overwhelmed by people - my tiny little half room is feeling cozy and tucked away right now instead of cramped and contstraining.</p>

Writing stuff again. <create>Got a rudimentary curvey-type shader going yesterday.</create> Fought with it all day, but eventually got something cool looking going. <create>Met up with Jordan and worked on a DJ-style audio looping/layering/crossfading type system today.</create> Should keep me occupied this week. It was fun sorting out how to do accurate audio in unity - hoping to build something along the lines of a rhythm game eventually. Gained back most of the wait I lost over the last month. Got sick (after overworking myself and then overdrinking) and my exercise and diet went to pieces. I'm thinking I need to just try to move toward a more sustainable diet overall. Maybe more careful tapering, like I'm doing with my anti-depressants. I'm going to start growing brussel sprouts tomorrow.

Gonna make one game a week and put it on my website. Also decided to
start journaling publicly with semantic tags, so that I can do things
like looking back at gall-bladder issues, strength, weight,
etcetera. I've realized that science is one more area in which the
people can band together and just do it themselves, if we just take it
on ourselves to learn a bit and be rigorous. Excitable and
    productive <productivity>3/5</productivity>, though a little tired
(Energy <energy>2/5</energy>). Pretty good mood: <mood>3.5/5</mood>. Built this extension to my site.
